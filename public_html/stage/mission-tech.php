        <p>Writing computer programs can be a very satisfying personal experience and lead to a rewarding high-tech career.

        <img src="images/mission01.jpg" style="float:left;margin:3px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:8px;" width="145" height="146" />We believe that children can learn computer programming at grade and middle school ages, and that their lives can be

        changed in a positive way through the self-confidence gained from the mastery of computer programming skills and

        programming as an after-school activity. The skills learned at WTS will equip children to compete in an increasingly

        flat world and prepare them for high-paying jobs that await both High School and College graduates in computer programming.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>U.S. Technology Leadership</h3>

        <p>Only 26% of U.S. high schools require computer programming courses, and computer programming instruction is not offered in

        public grade or middle schools.

        </p></td>

        <td><br />We are unique in our approach to teaching children these skills <strong>before they typically get

        turned off to science in their early teens.</strong> This is a time when girls are particularly susceptible to opt-out. U.S.

        technology leadership is at risk, and a shortage of one million programmers is predicted over the next ten years.

        <br /><br /><h3>Customizable Approach</h3>

        <p>We offer flexible, individually customized learning schedules in a small classroom setting. Transportation can be

        arranged and tuition assistance may be available based on family needs.

        office building facility, where students are able to work on powerful, state-of-the-art Apple iMac computers.

        <br />Lessons writing game and real-life robot programs that utilize object-oriented programming techniques are designed

        to keep the students' interest and stimulate their imaginations and creative talents.</p></td>
