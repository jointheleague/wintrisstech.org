<b>Game Description</b>
</font>

<font color="#000000">
	Visit spectacular star nebula to clear asteroid belts and create a galatic superhighway.  See how rapidly you can clear the way through each of six
increasingly challenging and visually stunning missions.  Can you destroy the asteroid belts or will they destroy you?  Collect an an impressive array of Multi-Strike Phasers, Disruptor Missiles, Quantum Bombs and Ship Shields
to exterminate your adversaries.  Fully customize your ship's body, wings, and weapon pods.  And when you want maximum fun with the least amount of worry,
turn on Invincible Sheilds to render yourself indestructible.

FAQs:
</font>
<br>

<font color="#FF0000">Q: </font><font color="#000000">What is the bar at the top left corner of the screen?</font><br>
<font color="#9999FF">A: </font><font color="#000000">This is your phaser's Energy Bar.  Phaser shooting costs energy which slowly regenerates over time.  If the energy bar drops to the bottom
(meaning you lost all of your energy), you will lose a shooting level and will temporarily be unable to fire.  Use your phaser energy wisely!</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Q: </font><font color="#000000">I'm swiping in the direction that the ship is going to make it accelerate or decelerate, and it causes me to accelerate in the
opposite direction than desired.<br>
<font color="#9999FF">A: </font><font color="#000000">Acceleration and deceleration, unlike the ship turning using the touch screen, <u><b>is not relative to the ship's current heading.</u></b>  You swipe upwards on the 
touch screen to accelerate, and swipe downwards on the touch screen to decelerate the ship regardless of the ship's direction on the screen.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Q: </font><font color="#000000">Can I save my game after a level?</font><br>
<font color="#9999FF">A: </font><font color="#000000">Yes, the Home and Back keys allow you to exit and save the game at any time after Level 1. You can also save ship customization preferences and Top 5 scores.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Q: </font><font color="#000000">Why would I want the lowest possible score, instead of the highest?</font><br>
<font color="#9999FF">A: </font><font color="#000000">Like golf, Kosmos 3D is a low score wins game.  Expert game players will clear asteroid belts in the most efficient manner possible resulting in low Top 5 scores.<br>

<b>Kosmos 3D Game Development Summary:</b> Kosmos 3D Version 1.0 extends the limits of 3D game design for smartphone platforms.  Game play is rendered entirely using the 3D OpenGL API and makes extensive use of Kosmos Artists' advanced 
animation engine.  The gameplay experience surpasses that of any of the alternatives we've seen and will continue to improve in future versions.  Wintress Technical Schools and Kosmos Artists collaberated on the game development.  Jared Schrock,
Kosmos Artists founder at age 15, was the gameplay designer.  The non-profit Wintress Technical Schools supplied the Java programming skills.  Wintress Technical Schools is an after school program dedicated to teaching middle and high
school students Java programming skills.  Special thanks go to Aaron VonderHaar, Jim Johnston and Stanley Kerdziel.  Without their patience and giving nature, this game would have never have seen the light of day.<br>
