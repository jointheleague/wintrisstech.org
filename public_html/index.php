	<p><br />Wintriss Technical Schools (WTS) is unique in its mission of <strong><em style="font-style:italic;">teaching computer programming skills to grade and middle
        school children,</em></strong> preparing them to fill critical shortages of computer programmers expected within the next ten years.
        To maintain the U.S. position of scientific leadership, the children of today will need to know how to write- as well as
        use-the complex software of tomorrow. WTS trains its students in writing computer programs using the popular JAVA&trade;
        language and object-oriented programming techniques in a fun-filled environment.</p>
