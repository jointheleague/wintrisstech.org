h1. Workshop descriptions

h3(#intro). Intro to Java

Learn how easy programming can be. We'll complete two fun projects that you'll be able to take home with you, and you'll learn all you need to know to start writing your own computer games.

In Intro to Java, students will learn:

* How to download and install NetBeans (a free Java programming tool)
* How to use NetBeans to create simple Java games
* How simple mathematics, logic and design principles apply to programming computer games
* Games will include graphics drawn from basic shapes, images, controls using the mouse and keyboard, and animations.

h3(#girls_intro). Girls Rule: Intro to Java

A special session of our Intro to Java workshop for girls only. This workshop is assisted by some of our current girl students.
